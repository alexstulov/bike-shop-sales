# Bike Shop Sales
The project demonstrates data analysis opportunities with Python and Pandas using sales data from a bike shop as an example. Dataset contains info on 113036 orders with customer details, geography and finance for several years. Numerical and categorical analyses are carried out to identify trends, target audiences and gain insights. You may preview the notebook [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/alexstulov/bike-shop-sales/blob/main/src/bs-analysis.ipynb).
